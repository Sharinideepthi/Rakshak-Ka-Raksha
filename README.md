For us civilians, to feel protected and secure, many people at different levels put their safety and security at bay. Our soldiers, protecting the country's borders from external threats, are immensely respected and honored, which they deserve. Our police protect the law and order in society, enforce laws, investigate crimes, and ensure public safety. These professions are the most prominent ones in society and the reasons for our peace and welfare. They do protect us on a large Scale. But, do we leave our houses, apartments, Buildings, Properties, and even ATMs, with the trust in soldiers and police? We need someone for a close watch, who can protect our properties, safeguarding our immediate surroundings. They are often forgotten in the category of protection. They are the reason for us to have a calmer routine, and peaceful sleep at night. The Watchmen and Guards play a crucial role in the safety of individuals. They protect our properties and us from theft, crimes, and many unforeseen situations. But, they are no superhumans. A threat to us is a threat to a Watchman. 

After coming across many heart-wrenching incidents in recent times, where watchmen were being killed during the night, and these being reported the next morning, we decided that our protectors deserve to be protected and feel safe in their profession, like any other profession.
